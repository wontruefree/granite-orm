# Granite::ORM

[Amber](https://github.com/Amber-Crystal/amber) is a web framework written in
the [Crystal](https://github.com/manastech/crystal) language.

This project is to provide an ORM in Crystal.

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/amberframework/granite-orm.svg?maxAge=360)](https://travis-ci.org/amberframework/granite-orm)

## Installation

Add this library to your projects dependencies along with the driver in
your `shard.yml`.  This can be used with any framework but was originally
designed to work with the amber framework in mind.  This library will work
with kemal or any other framework as well.

```yaml
dependencies:
  granite_orm:
    github: amberframework/granite-orm

  # Pick your database
  mysql:
    github: crystal-lang/crystal-mysql

  sqlite3:
    github: crystal-lang/crystal-sqlite3

  pg:
    github: will/crystal-pg

```

Next you will need to create a `config/database.yml`
You can leverage environment variables using `${}` syntax.

```yaml
mysql:
  database: "mysql://username:password@hostname:3306/database_${AMBER_ENV}"
pg:
  database: "postgres://username:password@hostname:5432/database"
sqlite:
  database: "sqlite3:./config/${DB_NAME}.db"
```

Or you can set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.  This will override the config/database.yml

## Usage

Here is an example using Granite ORM Model

```crystal
require "granite_orm/adapter/mysql"

class Post < Granite::ORM::Base
  adapter mysql
  field name : String
  field body : String
  timestamps
end
```

You can disable the timestamps for SqlLite since TIMESTAMP is not supported for this database:

```crystal
require "granite_orm/adapter/sqlite"

class Comment < Granite::ORM::Base
  adapter sqlite
  table_name post_comments
  field name : String
  field body : String
end
```

### id, created_at, updated_at

The primary key is automatically created for you and if you use `timestamps` they will be
automatically updated for you.

Here are the MySQL field definitions for id, created_at, updated_at

```mysql
  id BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT
  # Your fields go here
  created_at TIMESTAMP
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
```

### Custom Primary Key

For legacy database mappings, you may already have a table and the primary key is not named `id` or `Int64`.

We have a macro called `primary` to help you out:

```crystal
class Site < Granite::ORM::Base
  adapter mysql
  primary custom_id : Int32
  field name : String
end
```

This will override the default primary key of `id : Int64`.

### SQL

To clear all the rows in the database:

```crystal
Post.clear #truncate the table
```

#### Find All

```crystal
posts = Post.all
if posts
  posts.each do |post|
    puts post.name
  end
end
```

#### Find First

```crystal
post = Post.first?
if post
  puts post.name
end

post = Post.first # raises when no records exist
```

#### Find

```crystal
post = Post.find? 1
if post
  puts post.name
end

post = Post.find 1 # raises when no records found
```

#### Find By

```crystal
post = Post.find_by? :slug, "example_slug"
if post
  puts post.name
end

post = Post.find_by :slug, "foo" # raises when no records found
```

#### Insert

```crystal
post = Post.new
post.name = "Granite ORM Rocks!"
post.body = "Check this out."
post.save
```

#### Update

```crystal
post = Post.find 1
post.name = "Granite Really Rocks!"
post.save
```

#### Delete

```crystal
post = Post.find 1
post.destroy
puts "deleted" unless post
```

### Queries

The where clause will give you full control over your query.

#### All

When using the `all` method, the SQL selected fields will always match the
fields specified in the model.

Always pass in parameters to avoid SQL Injection.  Use a `?`
in your query as placeholder. Checkout the [Crystal DB Driver](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-db)
for documentation of the drivers.

Here are some examples:

```crystal
posts = Post.all("WHERE name LIKE ?", ["Joe%"])
if posts
  posts.each do |post|
    puts post.name
  end
end

# ORDER BY Example
posts = Post.all("ORDER BY created_at DESC")

# JOIN Example
posts = Post.all("JOIN comments c ON c.post_id = post.id
                  WHERE c.name = ?
                  ORDER BY post.created_at DESC",
                  ["Joe"])

```

#### First

It is common to only want the first result and append a `LIMIT 1` to the query.
This is what the `first` method does.

For example:

```crystal
post = Post.first("ORDER BY posts.name DESC")
```

This is the same as:

```crystal
post = Post.all("ORDER BY posts.name DESC LIMIT 1").first
```

### Relationships

#### One to Many

`belongs_to` and `has_many` macros provide a rails like mapping between Objects.

```crystal
class User < Granite::ORM::Base
  adapter mysql

  has_many :posts

  field email : String
  field name : String
  timestamps
end
```

This will add a `posts` instance method to the user which returns an array of posts.

```crystal
class Post < Granite::ORM::Base
  adapter mysql

  belongs_to :user

  field title : String
  timestamps
end
```

This will add a `user` and `user=` instance method to the post.

For example:

```crystal
user = User.find 1
user.posts.each do |post|
  puts post.title
end

post = Post.find 1
puts post.user

post.user = user
post.save
```

In this example, you will need to add a `user_id` and index to your posts table:

```mysql
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id BIGINT,
  title VARCHAR,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX 'user_id_idx' ON posts (user_id);
```

#### Many to Many

Instead of using a hidden many-to-many table, Granite recommends always creating a model for your join tables.  For example, let's say you have many `users` that belong to many `rooms`. We recommend adding a new model called `participants` to represent the many-to-many relationship.

Then you can use the `belongs_to` and `has_many` relationships going both ways.

```crystal
class User < Granite::ORM::Base
  has_many :participants

  field name : String
end

class Participant < Granite::ORM::Base
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :room
end

class Room < Granite::ORM::Base
  has_many :participants

  field name : String
end
```

The Participant class represents the many-to-many relationship between the Users and Rooms.

Here is what the database table would look like:

```mysql
CREATE TABLE participants (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id BIGINT,
  room_id BIGINT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX 'user_id_idx' ON TABLE participants (user_id);
CREATE INDEX 'room_id_idx' ON TABLE participants (room_id);
```

##### has_many through:

As a convenience, we provide a `through:` clause to simplify accessing the many-to-many relationship:

```crystal
class User < Granite::ORM::Base
  has_many :participants
  has_many :rooms, through: participants

  field name : String
end

class Participant < Granite::ORM::Base
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :room
end

class Room < Granite::ORM::Base
  has_many :participants
  has_many :users, through: participants

  field name : String
end
```

This will allow you to find all the rooms that a user is in:

```crystal
user = User.first
user.rooms.each do |room|
  puts room.name
end
```

And the reverse, all the users in a room:

```crystal
room = Room.first
room.users.each do |user|
  puts user.name
end
```

### Errors

All database errors are added to the `errors` array used by Granite::ORM::Validators with the symbol ':base'

```crystal
post = Post.new
post.save
post.errors[0].to_s.should eq "ERROR: name cannot be null"
```

### Callbacks

There is support for callbacks on certain events.

Here is an example:

```crystal
require "granite_orm/adapter/pg"

class Post < Granite::ORM
  adapter pg

  before_save :upcase_title

  field title : String
  field content : String
  timestamps

  def upcase_title
    if title = @title
      @title = title.upcase
    end
  end
end
```

You can register callbacks for the following events:

#### Create

- before_save
- before_create
- **save**
- after_create
- after_save

#### Update

- before_save
- before_update
- **save**
- after_update
- after_save

#### Destroy

- before_destroy
- **destroy**
- after_destroy

## Running tests

Granite ORM uses Crystal's built in test framework. The tests can be run with `$ crystal spec`.

The test suite depends on access to a PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite database to ensure the adapters work as intended.

### Docker setup

There is a self-contained testing environment provided via the `docker-compose.yml` file in this repository.

After you have docker installed do the following to run tests:

#### First run

```
$ docker-compose build spec
$ docker-compose run spec
```

#### Subsequent runs

```
$ docker-compose run spec
```

#### Cleanup

If you're done testing and you'd like to shut down and clean up the docker dependences run the following:

```
$ docker-compose down
```

### Local setup

If you'd like to test without docker you can do so by following the instructions below:

1. Install dependencies with `$ crystal deps`
2. Update .env to use appropriate ENV variables, or create appropriate databases.
3. Setup databases:

#### PostgreSQL

```sql
CREATE USER granite WITH PASSWORD 'password';

CREATE DATABASE granite_db;

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE granite_db TO granite;
```

#### MySQL

```sql
CREATE USER 'granite'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

CREATE DATABASE granite_db;

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON granite_db.* TO 'granite'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

4. Export `.env` with `$ source .env`
5. `$ crystal spec`
